Dataset Description
The SMS Spam Collection Dataset is a tabular dataset that contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as either spam or ham (not spam). The dataset includes two main columns: one for the message text and another for the class label. It is commonly used for machine learning experiments related to text classification.

Machine Learning Problem
This project addresses a supervised machine learning classification problem. The objective is to build a model that can classify SMS messages as spam or not spam based on their content. Such a model helps in filtering unwanted messages and improving communication efficiency.
